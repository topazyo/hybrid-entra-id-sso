// Note: For these integration tests to run correctly, the Express app
// should ideally not auto-start listening in src/index.ts when imported.
// A common pattern is to have a separate startServer() function or only app.listen()
// when the file is run directly (e.g., if (require.main === module) { app.listen... }).
// For this subtask, we'll assume src/index.ts exports 'app' and doesn't auto-listen,
// or that supertest can handle an already listening app for basic tests.
// If `app.listen` is called immediately in `src/index.ts` upon import,
// these tests might have issues with "address already in use" if run multiple times
// or in parallel with the main server.
// A common fix is to export 'app' from index.ts, and have a separate 'server.ts'
// that imports 'app' and calls app.listen(). Tests would then import 'app'.
// We will proceed assuming 'app' can be imported and used by supertest.

    // --- This part requires a mechanism to make a health check fail ---

    // Let's assume we have a way to make the mock 'Database' check in HealthController fail.
    // One way: if HealthController's ConfigManager could be influenced by a test config file.
    // Or if HealthController had a method `simulateDbFailure(shouldFail: boolean)` (bad for prod code).

    // Given the current structure, this test is hard to implement reliably without altering app code for testability.
